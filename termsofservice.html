<h1 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last updated: April 20, 2025</p>
<p>When you use Afterwill, you are agreeing to these latest Terms of Service (“Terms”). Violation of these terms may, at our discretion, result in us terminating your account.</p>
<p>We may update these Terms of Service at any time. If we make significant changes, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and notify users .</p>
<h2 id="-definitions-">Definitions</h2>
<p>“We”, “our”, or “us” in any of our policies or terms, refers to Afterwill.</p>
<p>“Services” refers to our websites, including <a href="http://basecamp.com">afterwill.life</a>, and any product created and maintained by us, such as our desktop and mobile apps.</p>
<p>&quot;Last Message&quot; refers to a feature within our platform, a collection of messages and files to be sent to a group of people or an individual after no activity is detected from the user for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>Finally, “you” or “your” refers to the people or organizations that own an account on our services.</p>
<h2 id="-account-terms-">Account Terms</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password and for ensuring that any of your users do the same. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are responsible for all content uploaded to and activity that occurs under your account, including content posted by and activity of any users in your account.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-payment-and-refunds-">Payment and Refunds</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Our pricing may vary based on your country&#39;s VAT.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We offer refunds for credit that has not yet been used, and only via payment methods that allow it, such as a payment card. In case of payment via crypto currency, issuing refunds is not possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-cancellation-and-termination-">Cancellation and Termination</h2>
<ol>
<li>All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately upon account cancellation. Within 1 day, all content will be permanently deleted from active systems and logs. Within 2 days, all content will be permanently deleted from our backups. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-modifications-to-the-services-and-prices-">Modifications to the Services and Prices</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>We intend to support our Services as long as it is possible and reasonable to do so. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We may change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-uptime-security-and-privacy-">Uptime, Security, and Privacy</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer service-level agreements, but do take uptime of our applications seriously. Visit <a href="http://37status.com">status.afterwill.life</a> to see the status of our Services.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You agree that Afterwill may process your data as described in our <a href="https://37signals.com/policies/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> and for no other purpose. On rare occasion, our staff may access your data for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To help you with support requests you make. We’ll ask for express consent before accessing your account.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through. We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. Such as when your Last Message activates but the system fails to deliver it for whatever reason. We will attempt to deliver it manually.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To safeguard Afterwill. We’ll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an abuse report investigation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To the extent required by applicable law. As a Slovakian company with its main data infrastructure located on German cloud, we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a proper government authority with a legally binding order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2 id="-services-adaptations-and-api-terms-">Services Adaptations and API Terms</h2>
<p>We offer Application Program Interfaces (“API”s) for some of our Services . Any use of the API, including through a third-party product that accesses the Services, is bound by these Terms plus the following specific terms:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality is part of an application that remotely records, monitors, or reports a Service user’s activity, both inside and outside the applications. A third party that has built and deployed an integration for the purpose of remote user surveillance will be required to remove that integration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account’s access to the API. Afterwill, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to suspend your account’s access, we will attempt to warn the account owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we may cut off access without prior notice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-liability-">Liability</h2>
<p>You agree that Afterwill is not liable to you or to any third party for damages of any kind that result from the use of the Services, in ability to access data, or unauthorized access of your data or account. Afterwill is also not liable for damages of any kind related to actions of any third party that uses the Services, or any other consequences related to the Terms or Services.</p>
