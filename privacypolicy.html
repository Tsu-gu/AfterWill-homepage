<h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><b>Last updated: April 20, 2025</b></p>
<p>In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We never sell your data.</p>
<p>This policy applies to all products built and maintained by Afterwill.</p>
<p>This policy applies to our handling of information about site visitors, prospective customers, and customers and authorized users (in relation to their procurement of the services and management of their relationship with Afterwill). We refer collectively to these categories of individuals as “you” throughout this policy.</p>
<h2 id="-what-we-collect-and-why-">What we collect and why</h2>
<p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:</p>
<h3 id="-identity-and-access-">Identity and access</h3>
<p>When you sign up for a Afterwill product, we ask for identifying information such as your nickname and email address. That’s so we can contact you in case of a change within our Services or to send you emails checking for your presence.</p>
<p>We’ll never sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
<h3 id="-billing-information-">Billing information</h3>
<p>If you decide to top up your Afterwill credit via a payment card, you will be asked to provide your payment information and billing address. Payment card information is submitted directly to our payment processor and doesn’t hit Afterwill servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for purposes of account history, invoicing, and billing support.</p>
<p>In case you decide to top up your account&#39;s credit by using crypto currency, we only record the address it&#39;s been sent from.</p>
<h3 id="-anti-bot-assessments-">Anti-bot assessments</h3>
<p>We may use  across our applications to mitigate brute force logins and as a means of spam protection. We have a legitimate interest in protecting our apps and the broader Internet community from credential stuffing attacks and spam. When you log into you sign up for an Afterwill account the CAPTCHA service evaluates various information (e.g., IP address, how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to try to detect if the activity is from an automated program instead of a human. The CAPTCHA service then provides Afterwill with the spam score results; we do not have access to the evaluated information.</p>
<h3 id="-voluntary-correspondence-">Voluntary correspondence</h3>
<p>When you email Afterwill with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.</p>
<h2 id="-what-we-explicitly-don-t-collect-">What we explicitly don&#39;t collect </h2>
<ul>
<li>Geolocation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-changes-and-questions-">Changes and questions</h2>
<p>We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. If we make significant changes, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and notify users who have signed up to our <a href="https://37signals.com/policies/updates/">policy updates mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your information? Please get in touch by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@37signals.com">privacy@Afterwill.com</a>.</p>
